# Domain Understanding
**Domain understanding is a fundamental aspect of AI project development, pivotal in shaping the direction, effectiveness, and relevance of the solutions provided. AI, as defined by Spruit & Lytras (2018), is not just about the creation of analytical systems but is deeply rooted in the enhancement of the daily practices of domain experts. This enhancement necessitates a profound comprehension of the domain in question, attainable only through meticulous exploratory research.**

### Main Question 1:
**How does weightlifting and general exercise contribute to overall health and well-being?**

Methodology: 
For most of these Sub-Questions I have used Library research in particular Literature study to find general information. The sources used are documented at the bottom of this document. I also did field research in particular an [interview](./Interview.md) to find out more about the stakeholders needs and practices.

Sub-Questions:
**What are the main physical benefits for exercise?**
Weightlifting and exercise are really good for you in many ways. When you lift weights, you're not just making your muscles stonger. You're also helping your bones become stronger, which is important as you get older. This kind of exercise also helps your joints move better and can stop you from getting hurt doing everyday things.

Exercise in general is great for your body and mind. When you do things like run, swim, or ride a bike, your heart gets healthier and your lungs get better at breathing. This kind of activity helps you keep a healthy weight and lowers your chance of getting sick with things like diabetes or heart problems. Exercise also helps your body fight off germs better.

**Are there any ways that exercise inprove your mental health?**
Working out is also good for your brain. It makes you feel happier because it releases special chemicals in your brain called endorphins. It can help you feel less stressed or worried, sleep better, and concentrate more. Plus, it can make you feel more positive.

**What are the social benefits of group exercise activities?**
Exercising with other people, like in a class or a team, can also make you feel good because you get to make friends and be part of a group. This is really important for feeling happy and connected.

Conclusion Main Question 1:
**How does weightlifting and general exercise contribute to overall health and well-being?**
So, weightlifting and exercise are not just about looking good. They are really important for keeping your whole body and mind healthy, stopping you from getting sick, making you feel happier, and helping you make friends. They are a big part of living a healthy and happy life.

### Main Question 2:
**What is the significance of One Rep Max (1RM) in weightlifting and strength training, and how is it applied in AI modeling?**

Methodology:
For this question I used Field research to find out about common practices around 1RM. But the main research method was Library research to find more general information. Then I also did some brainstorming to try and figure out how 1RM would function as a target variable in AI.

Sub-Questions:

**What is One Rep Max?**
In the realm of weightlifting, 1RM is defined as the heaviest weight that can be lifted once with proper form. It is a direct measure of the maximal strength a person possesses for a specific exercise, like a squat, deadlift, or bench press. This metric is pivotal as it provides a clear and quantifiable benchmark of an individual's strength capabilities, serving as a foundation for setting training goals and tracking progress over time.

**What are the methods for calculating 1RM, and how do direct measurement and estimation methods differ in terms of accuracy and practicality?**
Calculating 1RM can be done in two primary ways: direct measurement and estimation. The direct method involves physically lifting the heaviest weight possible for one repetition. While this approach is accurate, it's often impractical and risky, especially for inexperienced lifters. To mitigate these risks, several estimation methods have been developed. These involve lifting a submaximal weight for multiple repetitions and then using mathematical formulas to estimate the 1RM. The most common of these formulas include the Epley Formula and the Brzycki Formula, which use the number of repetitions performed with a certain weight to estimate 1RM.

However, these estimation methods have their limitations. They can be less accurate for those with less lifting experience or for very high or low repetition ranges. The accuracy also varies depending on the specific exercise being performed. Despite these limitations, estimated 1RM is widely used because of its practicality and safety.

**In what ways is 1RM used as a foundational element for structuring and progressing training programs?**
The significance of 1RM in weightlifting extends beyond a simple measure of strength. It's intimately linked with training intensity and progression. For instance, many strength training programs prescribe exercises based on a percentage of an individual's 1RM. This allows for a tailored approach to training intensity, ensuring that the workouts are challenging yet achievable, and most importantly, safe.

Moreover, 1RM plays a critical role in designing weightlifting programs. It aids in the creation of periodized training plans, which are structured to vary intensity and volume over time to maximize gains while minimizing the risk of overtraining and injury. By regularly assessing and updating an individual's 1RM, trainers and athletes can adjust training loads to align with improvements in strength, ensuring continual progression and adaptation.

**How does 1RM serve as a target variable in AI models for weightlifting, and what makes it suitable for this purpose?**
Choosing 1RM (One Rep Max) as a target variable in AI models for weightlifting and strength training is particularly insightful due to its quantifiable and objective nature. As a measure of the maximum weight a person can lift in a single repetition, 1RM provides a clear, numerical benchmark of an individual's strength. This straightforward quantification makes it an ideal candidate for AI modeling, as it offers a precise target for prediction and analysis.

Conclusion Main Question 2:
**What is the significance of One Rep Max (1RM) in weightlifting and strength training, and how is it applied in AI modeling?**

1RM serves as a vital benchmark in weightlifting, offering a clear and objective measure of an athlete's maximal strength. Its role in calculating training intensity, monitoring progress, and designing effective weightlifting programs underscores its importance in the world of strength training. Despite the challenges in its calculation, 1RM remains a key metric for athletes and trainers alike, providing a foundation upon which to build and refine strength training regimens.

### Main question 3:
**What factors influence the prediction of One Rep Max (1RM) in strength training, and how do they interact to affect an individual's performance, especially in the context of a 20-year-old male engaged in weightlifting?**

Methodology:
For this research question I used mainly the Library research method once again. Only after using the answers gathered in the interview (field research) to find out more about the specific information relevant for my stakeholder.

Sub-Questions:
**How does the age range of late teens to late twenties impact muscle development and strength gains in relation to 1RM?**
Age is a significant factor in strength training. In general, individuals in their late teens to late twenties, like our 20-year-old gym enthusiast, are often at a prime age for muscle development and strength gains. During these years, the body's response to resistance training is typically at its peak, making it an ideal time to focus on increasing 1RM. However, it's also important to recognize that as one ages, natural changes in muscle composition and recovery rates can impact the ability to sustain and improve 1RM. Thus, for someone in their early twenties, capitalizing on this phase for muscle building and strength training is both timely and beneficial.

**How do gender-based physiological differences, including hormonal profiles, affect an individual's capacity to improve their 1RM?**
Physiological differences between genders play a crucial role in strength and 1RM. Men, typically, have a higher proportion of muscle mass due to hormonal differences, notably higher testosterone levels, which contribute to greater muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. This is particularly pertinent for our subject, as his gender aligns with these physiological advantages, potentially allowing for more significant improvements in specific areas like the chest, back, and arms, which he aims to develop.

**IIn what ways do an individual's body weight and composition influence their ability to achieve higher 1RM values?**
Body weight and composition are critical in determining 1RM. Generally, a higher body weight, provided it's accompanied by proportional muscle mass, can contribute to lifting heavier weights. However, for our 20-year-old, weighing 71 kg with a BMI of 21.4, the focus might be on gaining muscle mass to improve his 1RM. While his current weight provides a good foundation, increasing muscle mass through targeted training and nutrition will be essential for enhancing his 1RM.

**How does an individual's height affect their performance in various weightlifting exercises in terms of 1RM?**
Height can influence 1RM, but its impact varies based on the exercise. For taller individuals, some exercises like deadlifts may offer mechanical advantages, whereas others like squats might present more of a challenge due to the greater range of motion required. At 182 cm, our subject's height falls within a range that offers both advantages and challenges in weightlifting, necessitating a tailored approach to training that maximizes his biomechanical strengths.

**What are other infuential factors to take into consideration when calculating 1RM?**
Other aspects like training experience, muscle composition, and nutrition significantly affect 1RM. Given that our subject is very active, enjoys weightlifting, and has access to gym facilities, he is well-positioned to make progressive strength gains. His preference for structured routines mixed with varied workouts aligns well with the principles of progressive overload and adaptation, essential for improving 1RM. Furthermore, his commitment to a balanced diet with adequate protein intake will support muscle recovery and growth, directly impacting his 1RM potential.

Conclusion Main Question 3:
**What factors influence the prediction of One Rep Max (1RM) in strength training, and how do they interact to affect an individual's performance, especially in the context of a 20-year-old male engaged in weightlifting?**

The prediction of One Rep Max (1RM) in a 20-year-old male weightlifter is influenced by several key factors. Age plays a critical role, with the late teens to late twenties being an optimal period for muscle development and strength gains. Gender-specific advantages, particularly higher muscle mass and testosterone levels in men, contribute significantly to strength gains. Body weight and composition are crucial, where increasing muscle mass is essential for enhancing 1RM. Height impacts lifting performance differently across exercises, requiring a tailored training approach. Other factors such as training experience, muscle composition, and nutrition also significantly impact 1RM.

# Data Sourcing
**Data sourcing is a crucial starting point for any AI project because the quality and quantity of the data you gather directly impact the performance, accuracy, and robustness of your AI model. The old adage "garbage in, garbage out" holds particularly true in the context of AI. Proper data sourcing ensures that the AI model learns meaningful patterns and relationships from the data, leading to better outcomes and insights.**
## Define Objectives and Scope
**Defining the scope of this project is essential to set clear boundaries and expectations.**

Central to the project is the calculation of a one-time One Rep Max (1RM) for the subject, a 20-year-old male weightlifting enthusiast. It is important to note that this 1RM will be applied uniformly across all exercises, an approach that simplifies the process but admittedly does not account for variations in strength across different muscle groups. This assumption, while not entirely realistic, is a necessary compromise given the project's constraints and objectives.

Another crucial aspect of the project scope is the decision to exclude nutrition from our considerations. While nutrition undeniably plays a significant role in fitness and strength training, its complexities and the need for highly individualized information make it beyond the purview of this specific project. This exclusion is a strategic choice to maintain focus and manageability.

Additionally, it's important to clarify that the conversion of the calculated 1RM into a detailed training schedule is not included in the project scope. While the 1RM provides a foundational metric, the development of a tailored training regimen based on this value falls to the stakeholder. They have the option to utilize various available calculators and formulas to translate the 1RM into a practical workout plan. This delineation ensures the project remains focused and achievable within its defied parameters.

In summary, the project will concentrate on establishing a baseline strength level through a one-time 1RM calculation, while consciously setting aside the aspects of individual muscle strength variability and nutrition. Additionally, the application of 1RM in creating a workout schedule, though critical, is designated as a task for the stakeholder, allowing the project to maintain a clear and focused scope.

## Data Characteristics
**Given the specific scope of the project, focusing on a one-time One Rep Max (1RM) calculation without delving into nutrition or detailed training schedule development, the type and volume of data needed are adjusted accordingly.**

**Structured Data**
- Workout Logs: Limited to data that directly impacts 1RM calculations. This includes recent records of exercises, sets, repetitions, and weights lifted.
- Body Metrics: Basic physical measurements such as weight and height, which are essential for 1RM estimations. Detailed body composition data, while helpful, is not critical within the project's scope.
- 1RM Historical Data: If available, previous 1RM records to understand the progression and set a baseline for the current calculation.

## Data Sources
**Given the project's focus on calculating a one-time One Rep Max (1RM) for a specific individual, identifying suitable data sources is crucial. The data should be relevant, reliable, and accessible. Here are potential sources:**

**Possible Available Datasets**
- Research Datasets: Academic or research institutions may have publicly available datasets related to strength training and fitness.
- Open Data Repositories: Platforms like Kaggle, Google Dataset Search, or UCI Machine Learning Repository might have relevant datasets.
- Gym Database: If the gym where me and the stakeholder work out maintains digital records of members' workouts, this could be an invaluable source of recent and historical data.

## Data Legality and Ethics
**When sourcing data for an AI project, especially one involving personal fitness information, it is imperative to consider both legal and ethical aspects.**

At this point I am actively searching for a dataset, and after carefull consideration I have decided to focus on searching for a publically available dataset. The chosen dataset is available for everyone and may be used for academic purposes. 


# Analytic Approach
**The next step in writing a convincing proposal is to define a specific goal and an approach for the project. Goals for AI-projects are usually some sort of predictions, named inferencing. The result of this step is to define the target variable of the prediction, the nature of the target variable and to find out which of the features from the data are good indicato rs for the chosen target variable. Ultimately the result of this step is also the deliverable of phase1 namely a project proposal.**

## Target Variable
**The target variable is that one particular feature that you want to predict based on the other features.**

As previously mentioned, the primary focus will be on determining the one-repetition maximum (1RM) for three distinct exercises: Bench Press, Leg Press, and Deadlift. Users will have the capability to input their body weight, which will then be utilized by the algorithm to accurately estimate their 1RM for each of these exercises.

## Nature of the Problem
**Depending on the nature of your target variable, and thus the nature of the problem at hand, a suitable type of algorithm needs to be chosen. Choosing the "right tool for the job" is essential in obtaining high quality results.**

Using a regression algorithm to predict the maximum weight someone can lift once (1RM) in exercises like Bench Press, Leg Press, and Deadlift is a good choice. This is because regression is good at estimating numbers based on things like body weight. It's easy to understand how it works. Plus, it has clear ways to check if it's doing a good job (Validation). So, regression is a great starting point for creating a tool that predicts 1RM accurately and clearly.
